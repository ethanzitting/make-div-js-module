I've built this module primarily for my own use.\
It takes care of several portions of creating div elements in the DOM using JavaScript.

You can use it as follows:\
**makeDiv**(parentId, childId, htmlToUse, referenceChild);

**parentId** = the id of the parent element for your new div.\
**childId** = the id you want your new div to have.\
**htmlToUse** (optional) = the html you want inside your new div. If blank, it will not inlude anything.\
**referenceChild** (optional) = the ID of the child you want to place your new child above in the DOM. If blank, it will place your new child at the bottom.
